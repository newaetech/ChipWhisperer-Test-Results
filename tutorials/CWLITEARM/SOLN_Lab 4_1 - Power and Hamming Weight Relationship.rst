Part 4, Topic 1: Power and Hamming Weight Relationship
======================================================



**SUMMARY:** *In the previous part of SCA101, we used the fact a
relationship exists between the value of the bits being manipulated on a
microcontroller to recover an AES key*

*In this lab, we‚Äôll improve our model by looking at how power relates to
hamming weight.*

**LEARNING OUTCOMES:**

-  Understand hamming weight
-  Calculate hamming weight of a byte
-  Identify the point where the SBox output is being written
-  Plot power consumption at the SBox output vs.¬†hamming weight

        # First you'll need to select which hardware setup you have. You'll need to select a `SCOPETYPE`, a `PLATFORM`, and a `CRYPTO_TARGET`. `SCOPETYPE` can either be `'OPENADC'` for the CWLite/CW1200 or `'CWNANO'` for the CWNano. `PLATFORM` is the target device, with `'CWLITEARM'`/`'CW308_STM32F3'` being the best supported option, followed by `'CWLITEXMEGA'`/`'CW308_XMEGA'`, then by `'CWNANO'`. `CRYPTO_TARGET` selects the crypto implementation, with `'TINYAES128C'` working on all platforms. An alternative for `'CWLITEXMEGA'` targets is `'AVRCRYPTOLIB'`. For example:
        # 
        # ```python
        # SCOPETYPE = 'OPENADC'
        # PLATFORM = 'CWLITEARM'
        # CRYPTO_TARGET='TINYAES128C' 
        # SS_VER='SS_VER_1_1'
        # ```

Hamming Weight
--------------

Recall that the reason that there‚Äôs a relationship between power
consumption and the microcontroller‚Äôs internal data is that setting this
data takes power. We‚Äôve also seen that the more data that is set, the
greater the average power draw. It‚Äôs not far fetched, then, that there
should be some sort of consistant relationship between the number of
bits set to 1, called the **Hamming weight** and the power consumed by
doing so.

Hamming weight, despite being a pretty simple idea, actually isn‚Äôt
trivial to calculate (see
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_weight#Efficient_implementation).
You can write a function to do this, but in Python it‚Äôs far easier to
just convert to a string of bits and count the ``"1"``\ s:

Even better, create a lookup table (aka do the calculation for each
number between 0 and 255 and stick them in an array):

Our first issue that we run into is that we don‚Äôt know where the SBox
operation is happening. It should be happening pretty close to the
beginning (let‚Äôs guess and say within the first 2000 samples). One
thought is that we could group the traces by hamming weight and assign a
colour to each one. If we plot that, we might be able to find a pattern:


**In [10]:**

.. code:: ipython3

    from bokeh.plotting import figure, show
    from bokeh.io import output_notebook
    from bokeh.palettes import brewer
    
    output_notebook()
    p = figure()
    
    plot_start = 0
    plot_end = 2000
    xrange = range(len(trace_array[0]))[plot_start:plot_end]
    bnum = 0
    color_mapper = brewer['PRGn'][9]
    
    for tnum in range(len(trace_array)):
        hw_of_byte = HW[aes_internal(textin_array[tnum][bnum], key[bnum])]
        p.line(xrange, trace_array[tnum][plot_start:plot_end], line_color=color_mapper[hw_of_byte])
    
    show(p)


**Out [10]:**

Unfortunately, you‚Äôll probably find that this plot doesn‚Äôt really tell
us much; the part of power consumption associated with the SBox output
is just too small to pick out. We could try averaging the hamming weight
groups to make things more distinct, but that doesn‚Äôt solve the
fundamental issue of the SBox output being lost in the noise of
everything else happening on the chip.

Instead, let‚Äôs approach this from a different angle. Really, what we
want here is to remove the overall ‚Äúshape‚Äù of the trace and just leave
the signal from the SBox output. We could just pick a trace and subtract
it from each group, but subtracting an average of all the traces instead
will make the plot more distinct. Even better would be to have an even
weighting between all of the hamming weight groups, since the extreme
hamming weights (0 and 8) are far less common than the middle values,
but this won‚Äôt end up being super necessary (though you can still
attempt this if you‚Äôd like). The plot will also be more distinct (and
plot a lot faster) if we average all the hamming weight groups to remove
any outliers as well. Try implementing this (we‚Äôll again handle the
plotting for you):

Plotting this, you should get a very distinct spot where the colours
separate. This is where the SBox operation is occuring. In fact, it‚Äôs
probably distinct enough that you can choose the SBox loction solely by
where the graph is largest:


**In [12]:**

.. code:: ipython3

    sbox_loc = np.argmax(abs(hw_averages[0]-avg_trace))

Now that we know where the SBox operation is happening, plot the hamming
weight averages by their hamming weight at ``sboc_loc``.

**HINT: You may want to convert your hw_averages to a numpy array to
allow you to access by column. ``hw_averages[:,sbox_loc]`` will give you
``hw_averages`` at the sbox_loc.**

You should find that the relationship is mostly linear, which probably
won‚Äôt come out of left field. It makes sense that setting 8 data bits
will take roughly 8x the power that setting one does.

You will likely also find that the slope of the relationship is
negative, unless you‚Äôre on the ChipWhisperer Nano. This happens for a
good reason. If you remember how we are measuring the current into the
device, you‚Äôll find out that the voltage will go DOWN for an INCREASE in
current. You can see this in the following figure:

::

           Rshunt
   (Vin)----v^v^v^----------||------(To ChipWhisperer)
                   |
                   |
          (To microcontroller)

For the ChipWhisperer Nano, the slope is positive due to the presence of
an inverting amplifier on the input of the measurement port.

We are measuring the drop across the shunt resistor. An increase in the
current causes a higher voltage across the resistor. When no current
flows there is no drop across the resistor. But since we only measure a
single end of the resistor, we see a higher voltage when no current
flows.

We can fix the slope by simply inverting the measurement direction
(adding a - in front of the measurement).

Now that we know where the SBox operation is happening, try going back
to the original plot and zoom in to that section. Can you pick out the
difference between the hamming weights now?

Conclusions & Next Steps
------------------------

With this lab, you should be reasonably convinced that there is a linear
relationship between the hamming weight of data being set in a
microcontroller and the power it consumes from doing so.

In the next lab, we‚Äôll see how this can be used to greatly improve over
our DPA attack.
