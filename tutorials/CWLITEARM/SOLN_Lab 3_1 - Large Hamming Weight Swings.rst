Part 3, Topic 1: Large Hamming Weight Swings (MAIN)
===================================================



**SUMMARY:** *In the previous part of the course, you saw that a
microcontroller‚Äôs power consumption changes based on what it‚Äôs doing. In
the case of a simple password check, this allowed us to see how many
characters of the password we had correct, eventually resulting in the
password being broken.*

*That attack was based on different code execution paths showing up
differently in power traces. In this next set of labs, we‚Äôll posit that,
not only does different instructions affect power consumption, the data
being manipulated in the microcontroller also affects power
consumption.*

**LEARNING OUTCOMES:**

-  Using a power measurement to ‚Äòvalidate‚Äô a possible device model.
-  Detecting the value of a single bit using power measurement.
-  Breaking AES using the classic DPA attack.

Prerequisites
-------------

Hold up! Before you continue, check you‚Äôve done the following tutorials:

-  ‚òë Jupyter Notebook Intro (you should be OK with plotting & running
   blocks).
-  ‚òë SCA101 Intro (you should have an idea of how to get
   hardware-specific versions running).
-  ‚òë SCA101 Part 2 (you should understand how power consupmtion changes
   based on what code is being run)

Power Trace Gathering
---------------------

At this point you‚Äôve got to insert code to perform the power trace
capture. There are two options here: \* Capture from physical device. \*
Read from a file.

You get to choose your adventure - see the two notebooks with the same
name of this, but called ``(SIMULATED)`` or ``(HARDWARE)`` to continue.
Inside those notebooks you should get some code to copy into the
following section, which will define the capture function.

Be sure you get the ``"‚úîÔ∏è OK to continue!"`` print once you run the next
cell, otherwise things will fail later on!

        # First you'll need to select which hardware setup you have. You'll need to select a `SCOPETYPE`, a `PLATFORM`, and a `CRYPTO_TARGET`. `SCOPETYPE` can either be `'OPENADC'` for the CWLite/CW1200 or `'CWNANO'` for the CWNano. `PLATFORM` is the target device, with `'CWLITEARM'`/`'CW308_STM32F3'` being the best supported option, followed by `'CWLITEXMEGA'`/`'CW308_XMEGA'`, then by `'CWNANO'`. `CRYPTO_TARGET` selects the crypto implementation, with `'TINYAES128C'` working on all platforms. An alternative for `'CWLITEXMEGA'` targets is `'AVRCRYPTOLIB'`. For example:
        # 
        # ```python
        # SCOPETYPE = 'OPENADC'
        # PLATFORM = 'CWLITEARM'

Grouping Traces
---------------

As we‚Äôve seen in the slides, we‚Äôve made an assumption that setting bits
on the data lines consumes a measurable amount of power. Now, we‚Äôre
going test that theory by getting our target to manipulate data with a
very high Hamming weight (0xFF) and a very low Hamming weight (0x00).
For this purpose, the target is currently running AES, and it encrypted
the text we sent it. If we‚Äôre correct in our assumption, we should see a
measurable difference between power traces with a high Hamming weight
and a low one.

Currently, these traces are all mixed up. Separate them into two groups:
``one_list`` and ``zero_list``:


**In [5]:**

.. code:: ipython3

    # ###################
    # Add your code here
    # ###################
    #raise NotImplementedError("Add Your Code Here")
    
    # ###################
    # START SOLUTION
    # ###################
    one_list = []
    zero_list = []
    
    for i in range(len(trace_array)):
        if textin_array[i][0] == 0x00:
            zero_list.append(trace_array[i])
        else:
            one_list.append(trace_array[i])
    # ###################
    # END SOLUTION
    # ###################
    
    assert len(one_list) > len(zero_list)/2
    assert len(zero_list) > len(one_list)/2

We should have two different lists. Whether we sent 0xFF or 0x00 was
random, so these lists likely won‚Äôt be evenly dispersed. Next, we‚Äôll
want to take an average of each group (make sure you take an average of
each trace at each point! We don‚Äôt want an average of the traces in
time), which will help smooth out any outliers and also fix our issue of
having a different number of traces for each group:

.. code:: ipython3

    one_avg = np.mean(one_list, axis=0)
    zero_avg = np.mean(zero_list, axis=0)
    # ###################
    # END SOLUTION
    # ###################

Finally, subtract the two averages and plot the resulting data:

You should see a very distinct trace near the beginning of the plot,
meaning that the data being manipulated in the target device is visible
in its power trace! Again, there‚Äôs a lot of room to explore here:

-  Try setting multiple bytes to 0x00 and 0xFF.
-  Try using smaller hamming weight differences. Is the spike still
   distinct? What about if you capture more traces?
-  We focused on the first byte here. Try putting the difference plots
   for multiple different bytes on the same plot.
-  The target is running AES here. Can you get the spikes to appear in
   different places if you set a byte in a later round of AES (say round
   5) to 0x00 or 0xFF?

One other note that might trip you out: rememeber you are measuring the
voltage at the input to ChipWhisperer, which is measured across a shunt
resistor. The end result of this is that a lower voltage actually means
more power. So you might see the spikes flipped from the ‚Äúexpected‚Äù
direction based on a 1 taking more power than a 0.
